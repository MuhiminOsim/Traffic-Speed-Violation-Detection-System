# Traffic-Speed-Violation-Detection-System

The main objective of this project is to prevent traffic speed violation with an
automated detecting system.
The main concerns of this system project are given below:
- To recognize texts from real time video while driving
- To build algorithm for detecting traffic speed limit from recognized texts
- To measure current speed of vehicle using GPS
- To compare between current and maximum speed of that particular area
- To give warning and necessary information if current speed exceeds maximum
speed

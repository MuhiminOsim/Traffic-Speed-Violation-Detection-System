The main objective of this project is to prevent traffic speed violations with an automated detecting system. The main concerns of this system project are given below:

- To recognize texts from real-time video while driving with the help of Google ML kit
- To build an algorithm for detecting traffic the speed limit from recognized texts
- To measure the current speed of the vehicle using GPS
- To compare between the current and maximum speed of that particular area
- To give warning and necessary information if current speed exceeds the maximum speed
